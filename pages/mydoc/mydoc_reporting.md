The simulation metrics gathered in measurements can be written into simulation log files. So as to enable simulation logging, you need to add `@Logging` annotation to the class:

````java
@Simulation(name = "Server-Status Simulation")
@Logging(file = "/var/log/simulation.log", formatter = GatlingLogFormatter.class)
public class PerformanceTestingExample {
  
}
````

Formatter attribute specify the format of the log file you want to use. The framework supports Gatling simulation file format with
GatlingLogFormatter, so that the Gatling simulation reports can be generated by using Gatling
 tooling. You can omit the formatter parameter to employ the default formatting.  In addition, you can write your 
 own formatter by implementing the `LogFormatter` interface and develop your own tooling to create 
 simulation reports.

Moreover, during the load testing run, Rhino will also report the report into the stdout to show his heartbeat:
